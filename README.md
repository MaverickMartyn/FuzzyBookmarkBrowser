# FuzzyBookmarkBrowser

Just an alternate tool for searching through Chrome bookmarks when you have many.

Google Chrome's bookmark search (and especially the bookmark bar) tends to get quite slow if you have a lot of bookmarks.

This app is my attempt at a better solution for my own use.

## TODO
1. Add support for more Chromium browsers like the new Edge, Opera and Chromium itself.
2. Save latest chosen settings.
3. Maybe add support for gatting and caching favicons, in the background, when possible.
4. Opening in more browsers.
5. Make repo public, because why not.
